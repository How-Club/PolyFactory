- Added Arithmetic Operator:
  - New "data" block!
  - It has two inputs and an output, with all of them having configurable channel and direction, while still allowing overlap.
  - Can be used to execute operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
  - Can operate in 4 modes: Integer, Decimal, Boolean and String.
  - Can be crafted with 4 Copper Ingots, 4 Steel Plates and 1 Integrated Circuit.
- Added Data Memory Block:
  - Another new "data" block!
  - It has single connectable side, working as both input and output.
  - It can be used to store any type of data.
  - By default, any signal it receives overrides stored state, but it can be set to "read only" state with a wrench.
  - Breaking it keeps the stored data, allowing you to easily move it.
  - You can reset it by putting it in crafting.
  - Can be crafted with 4 Gold Ingots, 4 Steel Plates and 1 Copper Block.
- Added Turntable:
  - Currently can be used to rotate entities on top of it.
  - Crafted with a Wooden Slab and an Axle.
- Added Steel Button:
  - Fastest button in the game (5 ticks of activation).
  - Crafted with a single Steel Ingot.
- Mechanical Placers can now use items on entities!
  - Supports using items such as Shears or Buckets.
- Wrench changes:
  - Added "alt actions" to Wrenches:
    - Can be used by pressing F / item hand swap key.
    - Instead of swapping hands, it will perform alternative action on a block.
    - Currently only one available is making direction setting face the player.
    - By default falls back to the main action.
  - Added translations for many wrench action values!
- Recipe changes:
  - Steel Gear recipe now gives 3 gears instead of 2.
  - Large Steel Gear recipe requires now only a single Steel Ingot instead of two.
- New textures: Steel Alloy Mixture.
- You can now put Potato on a Spring on your head.
- Tweaked how cables/data is handled:
  - Channels now display from 1 to 4 (inclusive) instead of 0 to 3.
  - Data is no longer sent instantly, instead it's sent only at the end of the tick.
  - This allows to allow concurrent modification/bugs caused by elements that can be received and send the signal.
  - This might change behaviour of some existing cable circuits, so make sure to check if things work!
