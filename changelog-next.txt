- Added Tachometer (measures rotations per minute) and Stressometer (measures stress units left).
  Both require connection to some display (Hologram Projector, Nixie Tube) to display their values.

  - Added option to force everything to display as text.
  - Added option to change pitch and yaw aside of just roll of hologram.
  - Fixed some bugs with displaying holograms.
- Mechanical Placers can now use selected items on blocks.

- Added breaking particles to all the blocks that didn't have them.
- All crafting-machines should now work with hoppers.
