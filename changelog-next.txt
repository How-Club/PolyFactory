- Added Tachometer (measures rotations per minute) and Stressometer (measures stress units left).
  Both require connection to some display (Hologram Projector, Nixie Tube) to display their values.
- Added Spray Can. It can be used to recolor Cables, Nixie Tubes, Lamps and most vanilla colored blocks.
  You can create it in Mechanical Press with Empty Bucket and Copper Ingot. You can fill it with dye by putting it in the inventory (like bundles), with 8 charges per dye.
- Reworked general "data provider/receiver blocks" (Item Counter, Nixie Tube Controller, Block Observer, Item Reader, Redstone Input/Output):
  - Instead of having single directional input/output, you need to place cable inside of it.
  - The cable connects the same way as regular one, excluding the direction data-block is facing.
  - Existing blocks will convert to the new ones, without any changes in connection until you change them yourself.
- Improved Hologram Projectors:
  - Added option to force everything to display as text.
  - Added option to change pitch and yaw aside of just roll of hologram.
  - Fixed some bugs with displaying holograms.
- Mechanical Placers can now use selected items on blocks.
- Improved physics of players effected by fans.
- Improved placement of Windmills to always point to connected side.
- Added new advancements, pointing to recently added things.
- Hoppers, Pistons, Redstone Repeater, Redstone Comparator, Dispensers and Droppers can be rotated by using Wrench.
- Added breaking particles to all the blocks that didn't have them.
- All crafting-machines should now work with hoppers.
- Fixed dynamic blocks not having correct visuals sometimes.
- Changed multiple textures and models:
  - Most notably: Item Splitter, Cables, Wireless Redstone Input/Output, Treated Kelp and Ender-Amethyst Crystal
